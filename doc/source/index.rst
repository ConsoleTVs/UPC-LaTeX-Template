UPC LaTeX Template

What is LaTeX?
--------------
LaTeX is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing.

LaTeX is not a word processor! Instead, LaTeX encourages authors not to worry too much about the appearance of their documents but to concentrate on getting the right content.

So we took a bit of timing to take care of the design, changing things to make them look like the official documents provided on UPC

What is a template?
-------------------
Pandoc make use of LaTeX templates to design your pdf, so in fact our template is a preset configuration to ensure your document meets the line between a fancy document and powerful one.
